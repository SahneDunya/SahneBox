# SahneBox
SahneBox is the first operating system to use Sahne Karnal architecture. Sahne Karnal architecture is a series of kernels developed by Sahne Dünya and components built on it. Sahne Karnal is also an independent operating system project initiated by Sahne Dünya. This is a very important step because many operating systems use Linux kernels, most of those that use their own kernels have a Unix infrastructure, and so far very few operating systems have been able to come out with both their own kernel and their own principles. Sahne Karnal is included here among this percentage. Also, SahneBox operating system is the first application of this. Since SahneBox operating system is the first application, it is quite normal for it to be simple compared to modern systems. Also, SahneBox does not use Standard Sahne Karnal, instead it uses a customized version. But the other reason is that SahneBox is not a general-purpose operating system. SahneBox operating system was created for an electronic device called PacketBox. For more information, please examine the Target Electronics device.png file. This electronic device is known as a box-top computer integrated with a refrigerator. When you look at the PNG file, you will understand what it is like. In other words, this operating system is a bit of a hobby, but the real plan starts with Sahne DünyaOS SQUAD. Because Sahne DünyaOS SQUAD is the main operating system series developed by Sahne Dünya. This series uses Sahne Karnal architecture. So why this could be such a serious plan will be clear in the future!
